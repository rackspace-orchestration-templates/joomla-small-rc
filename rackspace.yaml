  Joomla is a flexible content management system, written in PHP, that allows
  for the creation of powerful web applications and sites.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Joomla, the [Beginner Tutorials](https://docs.joomla.org/Beginner_Tutorials)
  documentation will step you through the process of logging into the admin
  panel, customizing your blog, and changing your theme.

  After the stack has been created, you can find the admin username and
  password listed in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  If you provided a domain name that is associated with your Rackspace Cloud
  account and chose to create DNS records, you should be able to navigate to
  the provided domain name in your browser. If DNS has not been configured yet,
  please refer to this
  [documentation](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on how to setup your hosts file to allow your browser to access your
  deployment via domain name. Please note: some applications like WordPress,
  Drupal, Joomla, and Magento may not work properly unless accessed via domain name.
  DNS should point to the IP address of the Load Balancer.

  #### Migrating an Existing Site
  If you'd like to move your existing site to this deployment, there is a
  tutorial available [here](https://docs.joomla.org/Copying_a_Joomla_website).

  #### Extensions
  There are over 23,000 plugins that have been created by an engaged developer
  community. The [Extensions directory](http://extensions.joomla.org/)
  provides an easy way to discover popular extensions that other users have found
  to be helpful. Please note that adding plugins can negatively impact the
  performance of your site.

  #### Scaling out
  This deployment is configured to be able to scale out easily.  However,
  if you are expecting higher levels of traffic, please look into one of our
  larger-scale stacks.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
  Once the stack has been deployed, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the stack
  is updated.**

  Joomla was downloaded directly from [joomla.org](http://joomla.org/). Joomla
  is installed in /var/www/vhosts/YOUR DOMAIN/httpdocs and served by [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).
  The nginx configuration file will be named using the domain name used as a
  part of this deployment (for example, domain.com.conf).

  Because this stack is intended for lower-traffic deployments, there is no
  caching configured.

  [Lsyncd](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd) has been installed in order to
  sync static content from the Master server to all secondary servers.
  When uploading content, it only needs to be uploaded to the Master node,
  and will be automatically synchronized to all secondary nodes.

  MySQL is being hosted on a Cloud Database instance, running MySQL 5.1.
  Backups for MySQL are provided by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/),
  which is running on the Master server.

  Backups are configured using Cloud Backups.  The Master server is configured
  to back up /var/spool/holland and /var/www once per week, and to retain
  these backups for 30 days.

  In order to restore the Database from backup, you will need to first restore
  /var/spool/holland from the appropriate Cloud Backup.  After you have done so,
  you will need to log into the Master server and restore the Holland backup
  to the Cloud Database via the MySQL client.  For more assistance, please
  contact your Support team.

  Monitoring is configured to verify that nginx is running on both the Master
  and all secondary servers, as well as that the Cloud Load Balancer is
  functioning.  Additionally, the default CPU, RAM, and Filesystem checks
  are in place on all servers.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided with this deployment can be used to log in as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
  This key can be used to log into all servers on this deployment.
  Additionally, passwordless authentication is configured from the Master
  server to all secondary servers.

  #### Additional Notes
  You can add additional servers to this deployment by updating the
  "server_count" parameter for this stack. This deployment is
  intended for low to medium traffic production websites and can be
  scaled as needed to accommodate future growth.

  When scaling this deployment by adjusting the "server_count" parameter,
  make sure that you DO NOT change the "database_flavor" and "database_disk"
  parameters, as this will result in the loss of all data within the
  database.

  This stack will not ensure that Joomla or the servers themselves are
  up-to-date.  You are responsible for ensuring that all software is
  updated.

 This stack is intended for low to medium traffic production
 websites and can be scaled as needed to accommodate future
 growth.  This stack includes a Cloud Load Balancer, Cloud
 Database, and a Master server (plus optional secondary
 servers).  It also includes Cloud Monitoring and Cloud
 Backups.

 This stack is running the latest version of
 [Joomla](http://joomla.org/),
 [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/),
 and [PHP FPM](http://php-fpm.org/).
 with a Cloud Database running
 [MySQL 5.1](http://www.mysql.com/about/).

 This template will only function with RackConnect v3.
